            <p>This website is for individuals who are curious on anothers opinion of music they might want to listen to next. 
                The website is written by an album critic who rates albums out of 10 based on their discography, fluency & consistency, 
                production, duration, lyricism, connections, distinction, popularity, how underrated or underappreciated it is, theme, 
                impact, innovation & creativity and sometimes even the cover art (in this case not really). 
                The purpose of this website from my point of view was to express my opinion on certain albums and singles that I believe 
                have something about them that stands out from others.</p>

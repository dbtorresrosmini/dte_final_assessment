          <p id="paragraph2">In my opinion, this is undeniably Kanye West's magnum opus. The balance between album length and consistency is impressive, especially as it reaches the middle, where the tracks become more chaotic and experimental. Kanye is widely regarded as one of the greatest producers, particularly in his early 2010s releases, and My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy is a masterclass in showcasing his full range of capabilities. <br>
            The standout track for me is "Dark Fantasy," which, despite sitting at around 245 million streams, truly encapsulates the essence of Kanye's genius. When compared to the album's more popular hit, "POWER," which has amassed over 1 billion streams, it's clear that "Dark Fantasy" possesses a unique charm and energy that makes it shine brighter than the rest. Perhaps it's the way the track builds gradually, or maybe it’s just that I have a soft spot for powerful album intros, but there's something undeniably captivating about its progression. Although the latter part of the song could feel a bit excessive, the overall fluency and immaculate production keep it grounded as a highlight. <br>
            As for the features, they were solid choices for the era, though I feel some of them could have blended a little more seamlessly into the album's cohesive vibe. Kid Cudi's contribution on "Gorgeous," however, is a standout moment. Easily one of the best collaborations between him and Kanye, with their chemistry truly elevating the track. <br>
            Some of the most underappreciated tracks on the album are actually hidden gems, showcasing remarkable craftsmanship that deserves far more attention. The smallest track on the album “Who Will Survive In America” is okay, but some other tracks stand out far more. Take "So Appalled," for instance. it's baffling that this track only has 97 million streams, especially considering its production stands out even among some of the album's more popular songs. The features are spot-on, and Pusha T's verse? Absolutely unforgettable. It's a standout moment that elevates the track to another level. Without a doubt, "So Appalled" is one of the most underrated pieces of this entire project. <br>
            Of course, not every song left an impression on me. While "Blame Game" starts strong, it ultimately overstays its welcome, dragging on far too long which gives reason to the very small 98 million streams. The much-anticipated feature from John Legend fell flat for me, as the excessive use of autotune dulled the raw emotion of his vocals. <br>
            Overall, Kanye West absolutely nailed the production on My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy. It’s a bold, ambitious album that pushes boundaries while still staying grounded in its brilliance. This album gets a 10/10 from me. There could still be room for improvement with the features, but still an overall amazing performance and easily Kanye’s best album of all time.

          <p id="paragraph3">KAYTRANADA’s best-selling album truly lives up to its title, delivering a masterclass in rhythm and production. The album’s diverse range of styles showcases KAYTRANADA’s unmatched ability to blend genres seamlessly. Despite his undeniable talent, he remains one of the most underrated and underappreciated producers of our generation, and I’m eager to see his popularity grow over time. <br>
            The one track that absolutely stood out to me was "GOT IT GOOD," which, with about 93 million streams, deserves way more recognition. The feature from Craig David is a perfect match for the song's vibe, guiding the lyrical performance with effortless smoothness throughout. When compared to the more popular "YOU’RE THE ONE," which has over 210 million streams, it’s a tough call between the two. "YOU’RE THE ONE" also boasts a stellar feature and exceptional production. It's undeniably perfect for those summer vibes. But even with its widespread success, these two tracks don't hold a candle to what I consider the best feature and most underrated moment on the album, which was VIC MENSA’s scorching performance on "DRIVE ME CRAZY" sitting at only a mindblowing 28 million streams. The hip-hop-inspired production marks a bold departure from KAYTRANADA’s usual style, yet he absolutely nails it, seamlessly integrating his signature sound with the fresh energy of the beat. <br>
            Of course, no album is without its missteps. A track like “WEIGHT OFF” didn’t quite hit the mark. While not a terrible song, it felt like an experiment that didn’t quite land, blending Afrobeat and hip-hop in a way that didn’t showcase KAYTRANADA’s strengths. When you compare it to something like the small-but-sweet “BREAKDANCE LESSON N.1,” the difference is clear despite the fact we compare it to the smallest song on the album. <br>
            Overall, though, this is a brilliantly unique and cohesive project that lives up to the hype. "99.9%" gets a solid 9.5/10 from me. KAYTRANADA continues to be one of my favorite artists, and I never get tired of diving into his discography. I’m super excited to see how he evolves in the years to come.

          <p id="paragraph4">Metro Boomin has solidified himself as one of the most iconic rap and hip-hop producers of all time, and his bestselling album Heroes & Villains is a testament to his unparalleled skill. With a roster of features from some of the biggest names in rap and R&B, Metro effortlessly showcases his production genius, blending each artist’s style with his signature sound. <br>
            For me, the standout track is "Around Me," which has racked up 323 million streams and is an undeniable 10/10. This song is a defining moment in Don Toliver’s career, highlighting his unique vocal style and proving just how talented he truly is. The production is hypnotic, with a subtly psychedelic beat that carries the song, creating an almost dreamlike atmosphere. <br>
            Another track that deserves more recognition is "Walk Em Down." It’s a prime example of how Metro’s production elevates the track to another level. 21 Savage absolutely goes off in the first half with an effortless flow, while Metro’s beat is a masterpiece in itself. The beat switch is nothing short of brilliant, seamlessly transitioning from a gritty hip-hop rhythm to a smooth R&B vibe, with Mustafa’s husky vocals providing a perfect contrast for the rest of the song. <br>
            However, not every feature hits the mark. While "Creepin" has the potential to be one of the album’s best with its haunting vibe, the feature from 21 Savage unfortunately disrupts the atmosphere that The Weeknd sets so perfectly. It’s not that 21 Savage is a bad rapper, but his contribution just doesn’t complement the mood of the track the way it should. <br>
            Despite a few missteps, this album also has some brilliant collaborations that elevate it. Travis Scott’s feature on "Niagara Falls" is nothing short of perfect. He absolutely owns the track, seamlessly blending with Metro’s captivating beat that practically feels like it’s lifting you off the ground. It's the ideal song for late-night vibes, with a vibe that sticks with you long after it ends. <br>
            There are a few tracks, like "Too Many Nights" and "Superhero," that didn’t quite make the same impact, and I’d argue they are a bit overrated. But the song that missed the mark most for me was "Raindrops." While Travis Scott's appearance on "Niagara Falls" was outstanding, his feature on "Raindrops" just didn’t hit the same way, falling flat compared to the more energetic moments of the album. When you compare it to a smaller and publicly forgotten track like "Lock On Me," you can feel the difference in how the songs land. <br>
            All in all, Metro Boomin’s Heroes & Villains is an exceptional piece of work. An album brimming with stellar production, brilliant collaborations, and moments that truly stand out. I’m giving it a solid 9/10. While not every track hit perfectly, the highs are more than enough to justify the rating. Metro really outdid himself with this one, proving once again why he’s at the top of his game.

          <p id="paragraph5">Drake has had a rough past 10 months, but he is a good and talented artist nonetheless. Certified Lover Boy may have one of the most polarising album covers in music history, but ironically, the music within is undeniably well-crafted, showcasing Drake’s versatility across hip-hop/rap, R&B, and soul. <br>
            The standout track for me is “N 2 Deep,” a collaboration with Future that, with 154 million streams, remains one of Drake’s most underrated gems in his catalog. From the addictive low bassline that grabs your attention at the start to the mind-blowing and absolutely disgusting beat switch, this track is pure magic. It transitions seamlessly from a mellow vibe into a hard-hitting anthem, with Future’s raspy vocals amplifying the energy and defining beat switches to their fullest potential. While “Fair Trade” with Travis Scott has nearly a billion streams and is an album favorite, “N 2 Deep” edges it out for me. The chemistry between Drake and the production makes it impossible not to hit repeat. <br>
            Another pair of songs that caught my ear are “Race My Mind” and “F*****g Fans,” both with under 130 million streams making them some of the most missable hidden gems. These tracks carry a dark, atmospheric vibe similar to “N 2 Deep,” but with their own unique more R&B-style feel. “Race My Mind” hits hardest during its late beat switch, making it perfect for late-night vibes, while “F*****g Fans” is one of the most memorable R&B tracks on the album despite it only having 80 million streams. You don’t often hear its haunting production unless it’s from legends like MIKE DEAN or The Weeknd, making these songs incredibly underrated. <br>
            As for the features, Certified Lover Boy has its share of standout moments. Travis Scott’s contribution on “Fair Trade” is solid, and 21 Savage delivers a catchy verse on “Knife Talk,” but Future and Young Thug on “Way 2 Sexy” steal the show. Young Thug’s voice on the final verse fits the playful vibe of the track perfectly, and his seamless transition into the beat makes him the MVP of this song. The quirky lyricism, backed by an infectious beat from TM88, makes “Way 2 Sexy” one of the album’s highlights and easily the best feature. <br>
            However, not everything on the album lands. “You Only Live Twice,” featuring Lil Wayne and Rick Ross, stands out as one of the weaker tracks. It’s disappointing, especially with Lil Wayne involved, as his verse doesn’t live up to my expectations. With less than 100 million streams, it’s clear many fans share my sentiment. <br>
            Despite some lows, “Certified Lover Boy” is a strong showcase of Drake’s ability to blend R&B with his signature style. Though a couple of songs don’t hit the mark, the album would have benefitted from trimming it down to 16 tracks for a more cohesive experience. I’d rate it a solid 9/10. While the tension with Kendrick Lamar may have overshadowed me and the public’s reception as it aged, I believe if I had rated this album a few years ago in a year like 2021 or 2022, more people would agree with my take. Drake remains one of the top artists in the game, regardless of the drama. <br>

          <p id="paragraph6">The title of "King of Rap" is undeniably earned, and Eminem proves it once again with his extraordinary performance on “Recovery”. This album, in my opinion, is one of the most overlooked albums in his entire catalog and unquestionably ranks among his best work of all time. It’s surprising to me how many tracks on this album have flown under the radar, especially considering that the period from 2000 to 2013 marked Eminem’s prime. Close to every track offers something memorable, and I've carefully curated my thoughts on each one. <br>
            Choosing the standout song from “Recovery” was not easy whatsoever. Nearly every track is solid, with the middle section really shining. I narrowed it down to two contenders. For sheer production value, tone, and lyrical mastery, “25 To Life” takes the crown. This track grabbed me instantly with its raw aggression and booming beat at the drop. Eminem’s delivery intensifies as the song progresses, creating a distinctive vibe that sets it apart from the rest of the album. But when it comes to catchiness, cultural impact, and sheer iconic status, “Love The Way You Lie” clearly steals the spotlight. With a staggering 1.8 billion streams, it’s the undeniable commercial juggernaut of the album. While it may not boast the same depth in production and lyricism as “25 To Life,” Rihanna’s hauntingly catchy feature was the perfect recipe for mass appeal, making it the second best on the album. I definitely believe it deserved to be mentioned after being my favourite song for some time in the past. <br>
            However, the real hidden treasures lie in the underrated tracks with under 100 million streams. Songs like “Talkin’ 2 Myself” and “Going Through Changes” stand out as poignant reflections of Eminem’s personal struggles, especially following his career’s lowest points, and his behaviour at home with his family, particularly his daughter. “Almost Famous” packs a punch with its high-energy sound, but it's “So Bad” that truly caught my attention. Despite its 85 million streams, this track is easily one of the best songs on the album. It’s hard to pinpoint exactly why it hasn’t garnered more love. I’m not sure whether it’s the structure, the song’s length, or simply its placement, but it’s undeniably infectious. The beat harkens back to “Relapse”, and the lyrics are super catchy, I find myself replaying this one more often than I should. If you're diving into the album track by track, don't skip this one. Don’t let the streams deceive you. <br>
            While Rihanna’s feature on “Love The Way You Lie” was undeniably catchy, Lil Wayne’s appearance on “No Love” packs a whole different level of energy. The song may have received slightly more praise or streams (370 million) than the other more underrated tracks, but it definitely deserves more attention. Lil Wayne’s peak from 2008-2011 was nothing short of legendary, and this track channels that era with its fiery lyricism and powerful delivery. The collaboration between the two on this hard-hitting, aggressive beat is perfect, making it one of the standout moments of the album. <br>
            But not every track on here hit the mark. The final two songs, “Untitled” and “You’re Never Over,” were notable letdowns. “Untitled” samples a classic 60s track, but doesn’t really make the cut as a memorable hit. Meanwhile, “You’re Never Over,” while slightly better, exposes the limitations of Eminem’s singing abilities. Something fans, myself included, have often joked about. It's hard to ignore that the vocal performance here falls flat. <br>
            Despite the contrast in quality across the album, Recovery still stands tall. I’m confident in giving this album a solid 9/10. With a bit more consistency, it could’ve easily been a perfect 10, but still, Recovery remains one of my all-time favorite Eminem projects. I think he deserves a well-earned rest after his long run as a rapper. <br>

          <p id="paragraph7">Kendrick Lamar’s surprise drop in November 2024 was nothing short of a huge surprise. It’s wild to think that, despite the unorthodox release, it ended up becoming one of the best-selling albums of his entire career. The album name and tracklist, with their subtle yet unmistakable jabs at Drake, were clearly born out of the aftermath of their heated rap beef throughout 2024. But beyond the drama, it sparked a resurgence of energy in Kendrick’s career—far beyond the mere echoes of a squabble. <br>
            Now, let’s talk about “Wacced Out Murals.” Honestly, how is this track not receiving the love it deserves? It’s mind-boggling to me that people overlook it, especially considering it opens an album filled with so much non-concept songs. The production is on another level, an evolution for Kendrick that transcends his usual style, and yet it seems to have slipped under the radar. To top it off, it gets buried under comparisons to "Luther," a track that, while not awful, simply doesn't hit the same highs. “Wacced Out Murals” has this electric, almost cinematic quality that should’ve sparked a much larger conversation, but it gets buried in the noise. <br>
            Then there's “Reincarnated.” A straight-up gem that feels like Kendrick was channeling the spirit of 2Pac with his flow, and honestly, it might be one of the best tracks on the entire album. Forget the overhyped singles, this one is criminally underrated sitting at less than 110 million streams. Kendrick’s flow, his delivery, the concept, everything aligns to make it one of the most powerful cuts. Both “Wacced Out Murals” and “Reincarnated” have one thing in common: they’re concept-driven, layered, and raw. And that’s where I feel like the album misses the mark. The more commercially accessible tracks are nowhere near as compelling as these two, and it’s frustrating to see them publicly overshadowed by songs that just don’t compare. <br>
            But let’s not forget the standout moments. “Man at the Garden” is an absolute must-listen. The tension buildup, the lyricism, the themes of Kendrick claiming his place among the greatest, everything in this song builds beautifully. It’s an anthem of self-assurance. Then there's “Gloria,” a track that, with SZA’s feature, utterly elevates the entire vibe. Her contribution here is a hundred times better than her verses on “Luther,” and it’s hard to ignore the staggering 92 million streams. This track encapsulates the album’s themes of victory in the rap game and, notably, overcoming Drake. It’s the perfect outro, and in my opinion, it’s the strongest feature on the entire album—by far. <br>
            Now, let's get into "Luther", I’ll admit, I’ve softened my stance, but the song still feels like a misfire to me. But what really left me scratching my head was “Dodger Blue.” I just can’t understand how this track has more streams than some of the album’s more complex concept pieces. It’s not bad, per se, but I just found it a bit too short and lacks the depth and variation needed to make it memorable. If it were longer or maybe slightly better produced, and has some better features, maybe it would stand out more, but as it is, it feels like a track that just didn’t have enough to offer. <br>
            While the album does have some standout tracks and received generally positive reviews, it doesn’t feel like Kendrick’s best work. In fact, I’d argue that it’s one of his weakest albums to date. I know some fans will probably disagree, but when you stack “GNX” up against masterpieces like good kid, m.A.A.d city, To Pimp a Butterfly, or DAMN., the difference in lyricism and conceptual depth is glaring. “GNX” just doesn’t hit the same. That said, I can appreciate the move of a surprise drop, especially with all the anticipation surrounding it. Overall, though, it earns a 7/10 from me. Kendrick can absolutely do better, but there’s still enough here to keep fans hooked.<br>

          <p id="paragraph8">Baby Keem has kept us waiting for four long years without a full album, but the wait is almost over. It’s confirmed that his new project, “Child with Wolves”, will be dropping this year sometime in the mid-year. Until then, I’m diving into his last release, “The Melodic Blue”, to share my honest thoughts. <br>
            There are a couple of standout tracks on this album that I believe truly deserve more recognition. First up is “trademark usa,” a song that doesn’t get nearly enough praise. The track’s transitions are near flawless, especially when it morphs into a full-on beat switch. The first half features Baby Keem effortlessly riding a smooth 130 BPM flow. The second half is where it really takes off. The track shifts from a laid-back rap beat into an aggressive, hard-hitting production with a higher-pitched, more intense Keem delivering his bars. The transformation is stunning. Another track that absolutely nails it is “16.” This song is pure summer magic. Perfect for those warm mornings and lazy afternoons. Personally, it’s my favorite on the album, and I’m thrilled to see it getting more love as time goes on. Keem’s vocal performance on this track is something else. Compared to his cousin Kendrick Lamar, Baby Keem has a surprisingly strong singing voice, and “16” is arguably his best vocal performance to date, showcasing his range and emotion in ways that are both refreshing and impressive. <br>
            The album also features some killer collaborations. Kendrick Lamar appears twice, on “family ties” and “range brothers,” both of which are standout tracks. Don Toliver’s contribution on “cocoa” is another highlight, with his smooth vocals elevating the song. But if we’re talking features, Brent Faiyaz on “lost souls” (the deluxe version) deserves a special shout-out. His verse was so powerful that it eclipsed Baby Keem’s own part on the original. It’s one of those moments that proves Brent’s incredible talent, and it’s right up there with tracks like “family ties,” “16,” and “trademark usa.” The original version was solid, but the deluxe cut was a whole different level. <br>
            Now, there were quite a lot of songs on the project, this includes the deluxe, and obviously, there are gonna be some that felt like mis-steps. “a life of pain” (on the deluxe) was so hilariously bad that it became unintentionally entertaining, believe me, I couldn't help but laugh, and there’s not much else to say about it other than it was definitely not a standout. Another track, “south africa” from the original album, was a major letdown. The production on this one didn’t do the song any favors. Baby Keem brought his A-game with the flow, but the beat was horrific, and it left the track feeling lackluster. <br>
            Overall, I have to admit that The Melodic Blue was a bit hit-or-miss. It had its high points but also some moments that didn’t quite hit the mark.I also seriously do not feel like this project had to be 26 songs in length. If Baby Keem had trimmed the fat and cut some of the filler, this album could have been an easy 10/10. He just has to stay more consistent. Still, the latter half of the project showed serious potential, especially with the strong beat switches and evolving sound. It left me hungry for more and highly anticipating what’s next. For now, I’m giving The Melodic Blue a solid 7/10. Baby Keem is a talent to hear, and if he continues to master those beat switches, he’ll have so much potential in the future. <br>

          <p id="paragraph9">I wasn’t exactly a massive fan of The Weeknd prior to this album but let’s just say it left me speechless from start to finish. I didn’t expect such a remarkable display of lyrical depth and consistency across nearly every track. The Weeknd has once again proven he’s at the top of his game when it comes to vocal performance, and this album stands as his most polished work yet, surpassing "After Hours." <br>
            Each song offers something unique, but some truly stand out. "Cry For Me" became an instant hit, alongside "Timeless," which is made all the more captivating thanks to Playboi Carti’s feature, and "Sao Paulo." However, I found that the second half of the album outshines the first in many ways. The last four tracks are nothing short of breathtaking, with "The Abyss" being an especially unforgettable cinema. Lana Del Rey’s collaboration with The Weeknd, set against a stunning blend of soul, R&B, and electronic beats, is pure magic. At first, I wasn’t entirely sold on this track, but as I tuned into every subtle layer of the instrumentation, I realised how extraordinary it was. The tension builds ominously, and when that drop hits, I get goosebumps every time. Lana’s final verse is the chef’s kiss. Although calling this the best song on the album might be a bold claim, there are certainly other tracks that also deserve their moment in the spotlight. “Baptized In Fear” is a track that I believe will become a fan favorite in time, just give it a year. Immediately following it, “Open Hearts” offers an amazing transition, showcasing The Weeknd’s ability to weave an EDM influence into an album rooted in soulful, introspective lyrics. <br>
            “Take Me Back To LA” is undeniably a top 5 track. The way the chords create that lush, captivating beat kind of reminds me of "In Your Eyes" from a previous album. And then there’s "Red Terror", an absolute powerhouse that feels way too overlooked. Its rhythm and beat hit so hard, and I can’t help but think it could be the best track in his entire catalog. However, I do wish it were a bit longer. The last verse is so impactful, but it takes up about a third of the song. If The Weeknd had trimmed the intro and given us a longer version of the song, it would have felt more complete. Still, it transitions seamlessly into “Without A Warning,” which is a perfect follow-up. It’s almost unbelievable that this track has only 19 million streams, it deserves far more attention. The production on “Red Terror” and “Without A Warning” is top-tier, showing the full range of The Weeknd’s production abilities. <br>
            Another standout moment from the album comes in the form of a surprise feature. Although the album doesn’t feature many collaborations, the track "Reflections Laughing" is a highlight thanks to Florence + The Machine and Travis Scott. Florence’s ethereal vocals take a while to decipher, but when they do, they add a haunting layer to the track, especially after the telephone dial. It took me a moment to recognise Travis Scott at the end, as his voice is pitched lower than usual, which sounded a bit odd, but once I did, I appreciated the unique flavor he brought to the song with his distinct bars, and shows just how much potential both him and The Weeknd have together. <br>
            With 22 tracks on the album, one particular song felt too short for my taste. "Opening Night" didn’t quite resonate with me, mostly because it felt more like an interlude than a fully fleshed-out song. Whether it was meant as a bridge to "Reflections Laughing" or just a brief track in the mix, it lacked the variety and depth that could have made it more memorable. <br>
            Despite this one minor error, "Hurry Up Tomorrow" is undoubtedly The Weeknd’s finest produced album to date. It serves as a powerful conclusion to his career arc, bringing the “After Hours” trilogy to an exceptional and cinematic close. The album’s consistency, seamless transitions, and track progression make it an absolute standout, with the final four songs being especially remarkable. For me, it’s a 10/10. As we head into 2025, I’d say this is currently Album of The Year. <br>

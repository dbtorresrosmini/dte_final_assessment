          <p id="paragraph2">In my opinion, this is undeniably Kanye West's magnum opus. The balance between album length and consistency is impressive, especially as it reaches the middle, where the tracks become more chaotic and experimental. Kanye is widely regarded as one of the greatest producers, particularly in his early 2010s releases, and My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy is a masterclass in showcasing his full range of capabilities.
            The standout track for me is "Dark Fantasy," which, despite sitting at around 245 million streams, truly encapsulates the essence of Kanye's genius. When compared to the album's more popular hit, "POWER," which has amassed over 1 billion streams, it's clear that "Dark Fantasy" possesses a unique charm and energy that makes it shine brighter than the rest. Perhaps it's the way the track builds gradually, or maybe it’s just that I have a soft spot for powerful album intros, but there's something undeniably captivating about its progression. Although the latter part of the song could feel a bit excessive, the overall fluency and immaculate production keep it grounded as a highlight.
            As for the features, they were solid choices for the era, though I feel some of them could have blended a little more seamlessly into the album's cohesive vibe. Kid Cudi's contribution on "Gorgeous," however, is a standout moment. Easily one of the best collaborations between him and Kanye, with their chemistry truly elevating the track.
            Some of the most underappreciated tracks on the album are actually hidden gems, showcasing remarkable craftsmanship that deserves far more attention. The smallest track on the album “Who Will Survive In America” is okay, but some other tracks stand out far more. Take "So Appalled," for instance. it's baffling that this track only has 97 million streams, especially considering its production stands out even among some of the album's more popular songs. The features are spot-on, and Pusha T's verse? Absolutely unforgettable. It's a standout moment that elevates the track to another level. Without a doubt, "So Appalled" is one of the most underrated pieces of this entire project.
            Of course, not every song left an impression on me. While "Blame Game" starts strong, it ultimately overstays its welcome, dragging on far too long which gives reason to the very small 98 million streams. The much-anticipated feature from John Legend fell flat for me, as the excessive use of autotune dulled the raw emotion of his vocals.
            Overall, Kanye West absolutely nailed the production on My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy. It’s a bold, ambitious album that pushes boundaries while still staying grounded in its brilliance. This album gets a 10/10 from me. There could still be room for improvement with the features, but still an overall amazing performance and easily Kanye’s best album of all time.

          <p id="paragraph3">KAYTRANADA’s best-selling album truly lives up to its title, delivering a masterclass in rhythm and production. The album’s diverse range of styles showcases KAYTRANADA’s unmatched ability to blend genres seamlessly. Despite his undeniable talent, he remains one of the most underrated and underappreciated producers of our generation, and I’m eager to see his popularity grow over time.
            The one track that absolutely stood out to me was "GOT IT GOOD," which, with about 93 million streams, deserves way more recognition. The feature from Craig David is a perfect match for the song's vibe, guiding the lyrical performance with effortless smoothness throughout. When compared to the more popular "YOU’RE THE ONE," which has over 210 million streams, it’s a tough call between the two. "YOU’RE THE ONE" also boasts a stellar feature and exceptional production. It's undeniably perfect for those summer vibes. But even with its widespread success, these two tracks don't hold a candle to what I consider the best feature and most underrated moment on the album, which was VIC MENSA’s scorching performance on "DRIVE ME CRAZY" sitting at only a mindblowing 28 million streams. The hip-hop-inspired production marks a bold departure from KAYTRANADA’s usual style, yet he absolutely nails it, seamlessly integrating his signature sound with the fresh energy of the beat.
            Of course, no album is without its missteps. A track like “WEIGHT OFF” didn’t quite hit the mark. While not a terrible song, it felt like an experiment that didn’t quite land, blending Afrobeat and hip-hop in a way that didn’t showcase KAYTRANADA’s strengths. When you compare it to something like the small-but-sweet “BREAKDANCE LESSON N.1,” the difference is clear despite the fact we compare it to the smallest song on the album.
            Overall, though, this is a brilliantly unique and cohesive project that lives up to the hype. "99.9%" gets a solid 9.5/10 from me. KAYTRANADA continues to be one of my favorite artists, and I never get tired of diving into his discography. I’m super excited to see how he evolves in the years to come.

          <p id="paragraph4">Metro Boomin has solidified himself as one of the most iconic rap and hip-hop producers of all time, and his bestselling album Heroes & Villains is a testament to his unparalleled skill. With a roster of features from some of the biggest names in rap and R&B, Metro effortlessly showcases his production genius, blending each artist’s style with his signature sound. For me, the standout track is "Around Me," which has racked up 323 million streams and is an undeniable 10/10. This song is a defining moment in Don Toliver’s career, highlighting his unique vocal style and proving just how talented he truly is. The production is hypnotic, with a subtly psychedelic beat that carries the song, creating an almost dreamlike atmosphere.
            Another track that deserves more recognition is "Walk Em Down." It’s a prime example of how Metro’s production elevates the track to another level. 21 Savage absolutely goes off in the first half with an effortless flow, while Metro’s beat is a masterpiece in itself. The beat switch is nothing short of brilliant, seamlessly transitioning from a gritty hip-hop rhythm to a smooth R&B vibe, with Mustafa’s husky vocals providing a perfect contrast for the rest of the song.
            However, not every feature hits the mark. While "Creepin" has the potential to be one of the album’s best with its haunting vibe, the feature from 21 Savage unfortunately disrupts the atmosphere that The Weeknd sets so perfectly. It’s not that 21 Savage is a bad rapper, but his contribution just doesn’t complement the mood of the track the way it should.
            Despite a few missteps, this album also has some brilliant collaborations that elevate it. Travis Scott’s feature on "Niagara Falls" is nothing short of perfect. He absolutely owns the track, seamlessly blending with Metro’s captivating beat that practically feels like it’s lifting you off the ground. It's the ideal song for late-night vibes, with a vibe that sticks with you long after it ends.
            There are a few tracks, like "Too Many Nights" and "Superhero," that didn’t quite make the same impact, and I’d argue they are a bit overrated. But the song that missed the mark most for me was "Raindrops." While Travis Scott's appearance on "Niagara Falls" was outstanding, his feature on "Raindrops" just didn’t hit the same way, falling flat compared to the more energetic moments of the album. When you compare it to a smaller and publicly forgotten track like "Lock On Me," you can feel the difference in how the songs land.
            All in all, Metro Boomin’s Heroes & Villains is an exceptional piece of work. An album brimming with stellar production, brilliant collaborations, and moments that truly stand out. I’m giving it a solid 9/10. While not every track hit perfectly, the highs are more than enough to justify the rating. Metro really outdid himself with this one, proving once again why he’s at the top of his game.

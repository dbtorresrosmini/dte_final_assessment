          <p id="paragraph2">In my opinion, this is undeniably Kanye West's magnum opus. The balance between album length and consistency is impressive, especially as it reaches the middle, where the tracks become more chaotic and experimental. Kanye is widely regarded as one of the greatest producers, particularly in his early 2010s releases, and My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy is a masterclass in showcasing his full range of capabilities.
            The standout track for me is "Dark Fantasy," which, despite sitting at around 245 million streams, truly encapsulates the essence of Kanye's genius. When compared to the album's more popular hit, "POWER," which has amassed over 1 billion streams, it's clear that "Dark Fantasy" possesses a unique charm and energy that makes it shine brighter than the rest. Perhaps it's the way the track builds gradually, or maybe its just that I have a soft spot for powerful album intros, but there's something undeniably captivating about its progression. Although the latter part of the song could feel a bit excessive, the overall fluency and immaculate production keep it grounded as a highlight.
            As for the features, they were solid choices for the era, though I feel some of them could have blended a little more seamlessly into the album's cohesive vibe. Kid Cudi's contribution on "Gorgeous," however, is a standout moment. Easily one of the best collaborations between him and Kanye, with their chemistry truly elevating the track.
            Some of the most underappreciated tracks on the album are actually hidden gems, showcasing remarkable craftsmanship that deserves far more attention. The smallest track on the album “Who Will Survive In America” is okay, but some other tracks stand out far more. Take "So Appalled," for instance. it's baffling that this track only has 97 million streams, especially considering its production stands out even among some of the album's more popular songs. The features are spot-on, and Pusha T's verse? Absolutely unforgettable. It's a standout moment that elevates the track to another level. Without a doubt, "So Appalled" is one of the most underrated pieces of this entire project.
            Of course, not every song left an impression on me. While "Blame Game" starts strong, it ultimately overstays its welcome, dragging on far too long which gives reason to the very small 98 million streams. The much-anticipated feature from John Legend fell flat for me, as the excessive use of autotune dulled the raw emotion of his vocals.
            Overall, Kanye West absolutely nailed the production on My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy. Its a bold, ambitious album that pushes boundaries while still staying grounded in its brilliance. This album gets a 10/10 from me. There could still be room for improvement with the features, but still an overall amazing performance and easily Kanyes best album of all time.</p>
